# LiNRR

This repo contains data extracted from various literature on lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction to ammonia (LiNRR). The data is taken from the main manuscripts as well as their corresponding supplementary data. The data includes Faradaic efficiency, energy efficiency, current rate and duration, electrode materials, pressure, electrolyte composition, and anything else available. The data was used to analyze trends, such as which electrolytes or electrochemical conditions lead to high rates and selectivities.
